# Simplified WP — Project Instructions

## Mission

A portfolio site built as a WordPress child theme of Twenty Twenty-Five, where TT25 provides structural scaffolding and our custom CSS system owns all visual design, layout, and responsive behavior.

## Architecture Philosophy

- WordPress is a CMS and templating engine. It is not our design system.
- `theme.json` defines design **tokens** (colors, type scale, spacing scale). Custom CSS defines how and when tokens are **applied**.
- The block editor offers **guided freedom**: editors choose from curated options, CSS has final visual authority.
- CSS methodology: **Hybrid** — BEM for components, utility classes for layout/spacing/responsive helpers.
- Responsive: **Mobile-first**, three breakpoints (768px / 1024px / 1440px).

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **No code auto-modification.** All code is delivered for manual copy/paste with exact file paths and placement context. Never write to project files unless explicitly instructed.
2. **Read before modifying.** Never propose changes to code you haven't read.
3. **No over-engineering.** Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary. No speculative abstractions, no feature flags, no backward-compatibility shims.
4. **No security vulnerabilities.** Escape all output, sanitize all input, use nonces for forms. No raw SQL, no `eval`, no unescaped user data.
5. **Single-project scope.** Decisions are optimized for this portfolio site. Do not abstract for hypothetical reuse.
6. **No dependency on WordPress DOM structure.** Do not rely on WordPress core block class names or DOM hierarchy as stable styling hooks. Override them in the normalization layer (`_reset.css`) if needed, but all component and layout styles must target project-owned classes (`c-`, `u-`, `l-`).
